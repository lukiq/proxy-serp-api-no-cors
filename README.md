# Serp API proxy with Express
This projects implements a simple proxy for Serp API API

It makes use of [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/), a minimal and flexible Node.js framework that includes a myriad of HTTP utility methods for quickly creating robust APIs. We also use the [Body Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) package, which is Node.js middleware that allows us to process any POST requests we receive.
